            <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment<br>
            created using encryption algorithms. The use of encryption technologies means<br>
            that cryptocurrencies function both as a currency and as a virtual accounting system.<br>
            To use cryptocurrencies, you need a cryptocurrency wallet.Finally, since you store your <br>
            cryptocurrencies in a digital wallet, if you lose your wallet <br>(or access to it or to<br>
             wallet backups), you have lost your entire cryptocurrency investment.<</p>

           <p> Cryptocurrencies are still relatively new, and the market for these digital<br>
             currencies is very volatile. Since cryptocurrencies don't need banks or any other <br>
             third party to regulate them; they tend to be uninsured and are hard to convert into a form of<br>
              tangible currency (such as US dollars or euros.) In addition, since cryptocurrencies are <br>
              technology-based intangible assets, they can be hacked like any other intangible technology asset.<br>
